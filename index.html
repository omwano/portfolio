  <section>
    <p>I studied Information technology with a bias in hardware and networking at the Jomo Kenyatta Univeristy of Agriculture and Technology, later I graduated with a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Nairobi. To kick start my career, I started working as a volunteer at a learning instituition in Nairobi where I was deployed in the computer lab assisting with maintenance of the Lab computers. I later on joined Kenya Bureau of standards IT networking team where I supported users, shortly thereafter I joined MTN Business Kenya as a Customer support engineer in the service delivery department. This is where my passion in networking continued to grow and I later on joined the technology division as a Network engineer. Right now, I'm working as a Service Activation Engineer at Safaricom PLC.</p>
    <p>The drive to pursue programming skills was mainly the need to work efficiently by automating some of the routine work processes and also to stay abreast with the current trends and for personal development as well.</p>
    <p>Off the clock, you will find me engaged in either of the following activities:
      <ul>
        <li>Aerobics</li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Reading journals</li>
        <li>Gardening</li>  
      </ul>
