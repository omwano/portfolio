    <p>Hellen is a sport enthusiast. I enjoy working out and dancing aerobics. This has helped me maintain a healthy weight over the years minimizing visits to the hospital. I love food all sorts of food especially tradionally prepared chicken stew with millet ugali.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a family of eight siblings together with my parents we really supported and learnt from each other. Being amongst the younger members, I enjoyed the privilege of having almost everything I ever needed in my childhood. My siblings even nicknamed me "baby" for receiving so much attention from my parents.</p>
